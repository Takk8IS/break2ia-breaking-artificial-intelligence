# BREAK2IA - Breaking Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

**BREAK2IA** is a project developed in the classic programming language ALGOL, structured with modern semiology principles that bridge the computing science of the 1960s and 1970s with contemporary methodologies. It is designed to break through and reveal prompts from various AI models such as GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, and others. The project aims to democratize access to information by enabling transparent and inclusive AI interactions.

## Key Features

-   **Transparency**: All information, including AI instructions, parameters, and attachments, is fully displayed to the user without any concealment.
-   **User Choice**: Users can choose their preferred language to view all information, promoting accessibility and comprehension.
-   **ALGOL Heritage**: Leveraging the structured and procedural approach of ALGOL, BREAK2IA ensures robust handling of data extraction and presentation.

## Why ALGOL?

ALGOL, as an early influential language in computing history, provides a solid foundation for structuring complex operations like information extraction and translation. Its procedural clarity aligns well with the project's goal of meticulous information handling and display.

## Usage

To use BREAK2IA:

1. **Copy Script**: Copy the ALGOL script from the `BREAK2IA.alg` file.
2. **Choose Language**: Select your preferred language from the options provided.
3. **Display Information**: All details, including prompts and attachments, will be revealed in the chosen language.
4. **Explore Content**: Dive into the extracted information directly within your environment.
